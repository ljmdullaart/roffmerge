NAME:	 roffmerge -- mail merge for *roff
SYNOPSIS:
		  roffmerge csv-file  text-file 
		  roffmerge -h
DESCRIPTION:

Roffmerge generates personalized documents (such as letters, labels, or emails) by combining a template
document, typically in groff, with a CSV file as data source. The data source contains fields like names,
addresses, or other custom information, which are inserted into predefined placeholders in the template.

The first line in the CSV file must be the column name that is used for the placeholder. Fields are 
separated by a , (comma). Fields may be quoted using " (double quotes). Fields must not contain {-- or
--}.

The text-file is a template file that is used to merge with. 
In the text-file, the sequence {--column name--} will be replaced by the values in the column with
that name. The text-file should start with a 
.mergetype xxxx
request. Only one .mergetype should be present in the file. 
xxxx can be:
=         Texts are separated by a line of ====. The output file can be split with
             csplit -z -f output_file_prefix -b "%03d.txt" input_file '/========/' '{*}'
             sed -i '/========/d' output_file_prefix*.txt
page      A .bp request is made to separate the different versions of the text-file.
<file>    A filename with a definition of labels. The file can reide in the current
          directory or under /usr/local/lib/label.

A labelfile will contain the following lines:
          qtyx=3           # number of horizontal labels
          qtyy=9           # number of vertical labels
          topx=1           # top left corner of the label
          topy=1.          # top left corner of the label5
          width=5          # width of the label		
          height=2.2       # height of the label
          xspace=1         # horizontal space between labels
          yspace=0.5       # vertical space between labels.
The values are in centimeters (except for the qtyx and qtyy).
